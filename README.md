- 👋 Hi, I’m @rovman2
- 👀 I’m interested home built ROVs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Github, it's not intuitive.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on using Blue Robotics Sonar on my working ROV that has two rotating side thrusters and a stern thruster with rudder and elevator.
Fast and agile.
